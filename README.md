## The Process

### Built With

- React JS
- Tailwind CSS
- React Router
- React Leaflet
- Swiper JS
- Firebase, Firestore, Firebase Authentication, Firebase Storage

### What I Learned

A lot. Truly. Almost 95% of my component was styled with only tailwindCSS, fully maximizing the superb utillity classes! Feels like my learning process is never enough and i just keep learning a lot of new things and on this project it was about firebase

## Continued Development

Will deploy the project later
