## The Process

### Built With

- React JS
- React Router
- Redux
- React Leaflet
- Swiper JS
- Tailwind CSS
- Firebase, Firestore, Firebase Authentication, Firebase Storage

### What I Learned

Learned a lot about tailwind since i ditched daisyUI and fully created my component one by one. Learned a lot about Firebase 9 and everything inside of it (Firestore, Storage, Authentication, upload Image handling). Finally my first project with Redux! it took a while to implement but i can see why people on the industry using this. It makes the application scalable

## Continued Development
